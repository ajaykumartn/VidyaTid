# FeatureGateService Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the FeatureGateService for the VidyaTid subscription pricing system. This service controls access to features based on subscription tier and provides upgrade prompts for restricted features.

## Implementation Details

### File Created
- `services/feature_gate_service.py` - Complete FeatureGateService implementation

### Key Components

#### 1. AccessResult Class
- Encapsulates the result of feature access checks
- Includes allowed status, message, current tier, required tiers, and upgrade prompt

#### 2. UpgradePrompt Class
- Structured data for UI rendering of upgrade prompts
- Includes feature name, description, current tier, available tiers with pricing

#### 3. FeatureGateService Class

**Core Methods:**
- `can_access_feature(user_id, feature)` - Check if user can access a specific feature
- `get_available_features(user_id)` - Get list of features accessible to the user
- `check_query_limit(user_id)` - Check if user can submit a query

**Feature-Specific Methods:**
- `check_diagram_access(user_id)` - Check diagram feature access
- `check_image_solving_access(user_id)` - Check image solving access
- `check_mock_test_access(user_id)` - Check mock test access
- `check_previous_papers_access(user_id, year)` - Check previous papers access with year validation
- `check_progress_tracking_access(user_id)` - Check progress tracking access
- `check_advanced_analytics_access(user_id)` - Check advanced analytics access

**Prediction Feature Methods:**
- `check_prediction_access(user_id, prediction_type)` - Check prediction feature access
- `check_prediction_limit(user_id)` - Check monthly prediction limits
- `check_chapter_analysis_access(user_id)` - Check chapter analysis access
- `check_prediction_insights_access(user_id)` - Check prediction insights access
- `check_smart_paper_generation_access(user_id)` - Check smart paper generation access
- `check_complete_paper_prediction_access(user_id)` - Check complete paper prediction access

**Upgrade Prompt Generation:**
- `get_upgrade_prompt(user_id, feature)` - Generate contextual upgrade prompts with pricing

## Test Results

All tests passed successfully:

### Test 1: Free Tier User ✓
- ✓ Access to basic_queries and ncert_content
- ✓ Blocked from diagrams, image_solving
- ✓ Blocked from prediction features
- ✓ Upgrade prompts generated correctly

### Test 2: Starter Tier User ✓
- ✓ Access to diagrams and previous_papers
- ✓ Blocked from image_solving and mock_tests
- ✓ Access to chapter_analysis and prediction_insights
- ✓ Blocked from smart_paper_generation
- ✓ Prediction limit: 2 per month

### Test 3: Premium Tier User ✓
- ✓ Access to image_solving, mock_tests, advanced_analytics
- ✓ Access to all prediction features
- ✓ Prediction limit: 10 per month

### Test 4: Ultimate Tier User ✓
- ✓ Access to all features including personalized_study_plans and priority_support
- ✓ Unlimited predictions (-1)

### Test 5: Get Available Features ✓
- ✓ Correctly lists all 12 features for ultimate tier

### Test 6: Upgrade Prompt Generation ✓
- ✓ Generates contextual prompts with feature descriptions
- ✓ Includes pricing for all available tiers
- ✓ Shows which tiers provide the feature

## Requirements Validated

The implementation satisfies the following requirements:

- **Requirement 1.5**: Free tier users blocked from premium features with upgrade prompts
- **Requirement 8.1**: Free tier feature restrictions enforced
- **Requirement 8.2**: Starter tier feature access controlled
- **Requirement 8.3**: Starter tier mock test restrictions enforced
- **Requirement 8.4**: Premium tier feature access granted
- **Requirement 8.5**: Ultimate tier unrestricted access
- **Requirement 13.1**: Prediction feature access control
- **Requirement 13.2**: Chapter analysis tier restrictions
- **Requirement 13.3**: Prediction limit enforcement
- **Requirement 14.1**: Complete paper prediction access control
- **Requirement 14.3**: Monthly prediction limits

## Integration Points

The FeatureGateService integrates with:
1. **SubscriptionService** - Gets user's current subscription tier
2. **UsageTracker** - Checks query and prediction limits
3. **TierConfig** - Accesses tier features and pricing configuration

## Security Considerations

- **Fail-closed approach**: On errors, access is denied for security
- **Server-side enforcement**: All checks performed on backend
- **No client-side trust**: Feature gates cannot be bypassed from frontend

## Next Steps

The following tasks remain in the implementation plan:
- Task 5.2-5.5: Property-based tests for tier restrictions (marked as optional)
- Task 6: Enhanced PaymentService implementation
- Task 7: Enhanced EmailService implementation
- Task 8: API routes implementation
- Task 9: Prediction feature integration
- Task 10: Scheduled tasks and background jobs
- Task 11: Frontend UI components
- Task 12: Cloudflare deployment preparation

## Usage Example

```python
from services.feature_gate_service import get_feature_gate_service

# Initialize service
feature_gate = get_feature_gate_service()

# Check feature access
result = feature_gate.can_access_feature(user_id, 'diagrams')
if result.allowed:
    # Grant access
    show_diagrams()
else:
    # Show upgrade prompt
    display_upgrade_prompt(result.upgrade_prompt)

# Check prediction limits
allowed, remaining = feature_gate.check_prediction_limit(user_id)
if allowed:
    # Generate prediction
    generate_prediction()
else:
    # Show limit reached message
    show_limit_message()
```

## Conclusion

The FeatureGateService has been successfully implemented and tested. It provides comprehensive feature access control based on subscription tiers, enforces usage limits, and generates contextual upgrade prompts for restricted features. The implementation follows the design specifications and satisfies all related requirements.
