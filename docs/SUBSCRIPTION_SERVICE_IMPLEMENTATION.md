# SubscriptionService Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the `SubscriptionService` for the VidyaTid subscription pricing system. This service manages the complete subscription lifecycle including creation, upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, renewals, and expiration handling.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 3.1: Core Subscription Management Methods ✓

Implemented the following core methods:

1. **`get_user_subscription(user_id)`**
   - Fetches active subscription for a user
   - Returns `SubscriptionInfo` object with all subscription details
   - Handles cases where no subscription exists

2. **`create_subscription(user_id, tier, duration_days, razorpay_sub_id)`**
   - Creates new subscription or updates existing one
   - Validates tier before creation
   - Automatically creates/updates usage records with appropriate limits
   - Sets subscription status to 'active'
   - Calculates start and end dates based on duration

3. **`get_tier_features(tier)`**
   - Returns feature configuration for a specific tier
   - Delegates to `tier_config` module for consistency
   - Returns None for invalid tiers

4. **`validate_subscription_status(user_id)`**
   - Checks if subscription is active
   - Automatically updates expired subscriptions
   - Returns boolean indicating active status

### Task 3.3: Subscription Lifecycle Methods ✓

Implemented the following lifecycle management methods:

1. **`check_and_expire_subscriptions()`**
   - Finds all active subscriptions past their end_date
   - Marks subscriptions as expired
   - Executes scheduled downgrades when due
   - Downgrades cancelled subscriptions to free tier
   - Returns count of processed subscriptions
   - Handles errors gracefully with rollback

2. **`renew_subscription(user_id, duration_days)`**
   - Manually renews a subscription
   - Extends from current end_date if active, or from now if expired
   - Reactivates expired subscriptions
   - Sets auto_renew to true

3. **`cancel_subscription(user_id)`**
   - Cancels user subscription
   - Sets auto_renew to false
   - Records cancellation timestamp
   - Maintains access until end_date
   - Changes status to 'cancelled'

### Task 3.6: Upgrade and Downgrade Methods ✓

Implemented tier change functionality:

1. **`calculate_prorated_credit(current_tier, new_tier, days_remaining)`**
   - Calculates prorated amount for upgrades
   - Uses daily rates based on monthly prices
   - Returns amount in paise (can be negative for downgrades)
   - Handles invalid tiers gracefully

2. **`upgrade_subscription(user_id, new_tier)`**
   - Upgrades user to higher tier immediately
   - Validates that new tier is actually higher
   - Calculates prorated amount to charge
   - Updates usage limits for current day
   - Clears any scheduled tier changes
   - Returns `UpgradeResult` with success status and details

3. **`downgrade_subscription(user_id, new_tier)`**
   - Schedules downgrade to lower tier
   - Validates that new tier is actually lower
   - Sets scheduled_tier_change and scheduled_change_date
   - Maintains current tier access until end_date
   - Returns `DowngradeResult` with success status and scheduled date

## Data Classes

Created helper data classes for clean API responses:

- **`SubscriptionInfo`**: Wraps subscription data with computed fields
- **`UpgradeResult`**: Contains upgrade operation results
- **`DowngradeResult`**: Contains downgrade operation results

## Key Features

### Validation
- Tier validation using `tier_config` module
- User existence checks before operations
- Upgrade/downgrade direction validation
- Status validation before operations

### Database Management
- Proper transaction handling with commit/rollback
- Context manager support for automatic cleanup
- Optional session injection for testing
- Atomic operations for data consistency

### Usage Tracking Integration
- Automatically creates/updates usage records
- Sets appropriate query and prediction limits
- Links usage to subscription for tracking

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation on errors
- Informative error messages

### Scheduled Operations
- Scheduled downgrades execute at end_date
- Cancelled subscriptions downgrade to free tier
- Expired subscriptions marked automatically

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`test_subscription_service.py`) covering:

1. ✓ Free tier subscription creation
2. ✓ Subscription retrieval
3. ✓ Tier features access
4. ✓ Upgrade from free to starter
5. ✓ Upgrade from starter to premium
6. ✓ Scheduled downgrade
7. ✓ Subscription cancellation
8. ✓ Subscription renewal
9. ✓ Status validation
10. ✓ Expiration and downgrade execution

**All tests pass successfully!**

## Integration Points

The service integrates with:

- **`models.subscription`**: Subscription database model
- **`models.user`**: User database model
- **`models.usage`**: Usage tracking model
- **`services.tier_config`**: Tier configuration and validation
- **`models.database`**: Database session management

## Usage Example

```python
from services.subscription_service import get_subscription_service

# Create service instance
service = get_subscription_service()

# Create a subscription
subscription = service.create_subscription(
    user_id="user123",
    tier="starter",
    duration_days=30,
    razorpay_sub_id="sub_xyz"
)

# Get subscription info
sub_info = service.get_user_subscription("user123")
print(f"Tier: {sub_info.tier}, Days Remaining: {sub_info.days_remaining}")

# Upgrade subscription
result = service.upgrade_subscription("user123", "premium")
if result.success:
    print(f"Upgraded! Charge: ₹{result.prorated_amount/100:.2f}")

# Schedule downgrade
result = service.downgrade_subscription("user123", "starter")
if result.success:
    print(f"Downgrade scheduled for {result.scheduled_date}")

# Cancel subscription
service.cancel_subscription("user123")

# Check and expire subscriptions (scheduled task)
expired_count = service.check_and_expire_subscriptions()
print(f"Expired {expired_count} subscriptions")
```

## Requirements Validated

The implementation validates the following requirements:

- **1.1**: Free tier subscription creation ✓
- **2.2, 3.2, 4.2**: Subscription activation on payment ✓
- **5.1**: Subscription expiration handling ✓
- **5.3**: Cancellation with timestamp ✓
- **5.4**: Cancelled subscription downgrade ✓
- **5.5**: Immediate upgrade activation ✓
- **9.1**: Prorated upgrade calculation ✓
- **9.2**: Immediate upgrade activation ✓
- **9.3**: Scheduled downgrade ✓
- **9.4**: Current tier access until end_date ✓
- **9.5**: Scheduled downgrade execution ✓

## Next Steps

The following optional property-based tests are available but not implemented (marked with * in tasks):

- 3.2: Write property test for subscription creation
- 3.4: Write property test for subscription expiration
- 3.5: Write property test for cancellation
- 3.7: Write property test for upgrades
- 3.8: Write property test for proration
- 3.9: Write property test for downgrades

These can be implemented later if comprehensive property-based testing is desired.
