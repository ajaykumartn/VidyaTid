## Understanding Predictions

### How Predictions Work

The prediction system uses advanced pattern analysis:

1. **Historical Analysis**: Analyzes 20 years of NEET papers (2004-2024)
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring topics, chapters, and question types
3. **Frequency Calculation**: Calculates appearance frequency for each chapter/topic
4. **Trend Analysis**: Detects increasing or decreasing trends over time
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns confidence scores based on pattern strength

### What Predictions Can Tell You

✅ **High-probability chapters** - Topics likely to appear in upcoming exams
✅ **Topic frequency trends** - Which topics are appearing more/less frequently
✅ **Difficulty distribution** - Expected ratio of easy/medium/hard questions
✅ **Subject-wise patterns** - Unique patterns for Physics, Chemistry, and Biology
✅ **Class weightage** - Distribution between Class 11 and Class 12 topics

### What Predictions Cannot Do

❌ **Guarantee exact questions** - Predictions are probabilistic, not deterministic
❌ **Replace comprehensive study** - Use as a guide, not the only study material
❌ **Predict new topics** - Cannot predict entirely new topics not in historical data
❌ **Account for syllabus changes** - Based on historical patterns, may not reflect recent changes
