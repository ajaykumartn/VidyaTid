OREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends that children’s life
at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a
departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system
and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and
textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic
idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us
significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined
in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers
will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue
imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and
freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed
on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination
is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as
participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change is school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual
calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to
teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how
effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address
the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at
different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher
priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in
small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates
the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this
book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science
and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book,
Professor A.W. Joshi for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers
contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals
for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations
which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and
personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring
Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education,
Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor
Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution.
As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in
the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will
enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

ATIONALISATION OF ONTENT IN THE EXTBOOKS
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content
load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises
reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential
learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has
undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes.
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have
been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the
following:
• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in
the same class
• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same
subject
• Difficulty level
• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through
self-learning or peer-learning
• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out
the changes given above.

REFACE
More than a decade ago, based on National Policy of Education (NPE-1986),
National Council of Educational Research and Training published physics
textbooks for Classes XI and XII, prepared under the chairmanship of
Professor T. V. Ramakrishnan, F.R.S., with the help of a team of learned co-authors.
The books were well received by the teachers and students alike. The books, in
fact, proved to be milestones and trend-setters. However, the development of
textbooks, particularly science books, is a dynamic process in view of the changing
perceptions, needs, feedback and the experiences of the students, educators and
the society. Another version of the physics books, which was the result of the
revised syllabus based on National Curriculum Framework for School Education-2000
(NCFSE-2000), was brought out under the guidance of Professor Suresh Chandra,
which continued up to now. Recently the NCERT brought out the National Curriculum
Framework-2005 (NCF-2005), and the syllabus was accordingly revised during a
curriculum renewal process at school level. The higher secondary stage syllabus
(NCERT, 2005) has been developed accordingly. The Class XI textbook contains
fifteen chapters in two parts. Part I contains first eight chapters while Part II contains
next seven chapters. This book is the result of the renewed efforts of the present
Textbook Development Team with the hope that the students will appreciate the
beauty and logic of physics. The students may or may not continue to study physics
beyond the higher secondary stage, but we feel that they will find the thought
process of physics useful in any other branch they may like to pursue, be it finance,
administration, social sciences, environment, engineering, technology, biology or
medicine. For those who pursue physics beyond this stage, the matter developed
in these books will certainly provide a sound base.
Physics is basic to the understanding of almost all the branches of science and
technology. It is interesting to note that the ideas and concepts of physics are
increasingly being used in other branches such as economics and commerce, and
behavioural sciences too. We are conscious of the fact that some of the underlying
simple basic physics principles are often conceptually quite intricate. In this book,
we have tried to bring in a conceptual coherence. The pedagogy and the use of
easily understandable language are at the core of our effort without sacrificing the
rigour of the subject. The nature of the subject of physics is such that a certain
minimum use of mathematics is a must. We have tried to develop the mathematical
formulations in a logical fashion, as far as possible.
Students and teachers of physics must realise that physics is a branch which
needs to be understood, not necessarily memorised. As one goes from secondary to
higher secondary stage and beyond, physics involves mainly four components,
(a) large amount of mathematical base, (b) technical words and terms, whose
normal English meanings could be quite different, (c) new intricate concepts,
and (d) experimental foundation. Physics needs mathematics because we wish
to develop objective description of the world around us and express our observations
in terms of measurable quantities. Physics discovers new properties of particles
and wants to create a name for each one. The words are picked up normally from
common English or Latin or Greek, but gives entirely different meanings to these
words. It would be illuminating to look up words like energy, force, power, charge,
spin, and several others, in any standard English dictionary, and compare their

x
meanings with their physics meanings. Physics develops intricate and often weird-
looking concepts to explain the behaviour of particles. Finally, it must be
remembered that entire physics is based on observations and experiments, without
which a theory does not get acceptance into the domain of physics.
This book has some features which, we earnestly hope, will enhance its
usefulness for the students. Each chapter is provided with a Summary at its end
for a quick overview of the contents of the chapter. This is followed by Points to
Ponder which points out the likely misconceptions arising in the minds of students,
hidden implications of certain statements/principles given in the chapter and
cautions needed in applying the knowledge gained from the chapter. They also
raise some thought-provoking questions which would make a student think about
life beyond physics. Students will find it interesting to think and apply their mind
on these points. Further, a large number of solved examples are included in the
text in order to clarify the concepts and/or to illustrate the application of these
concepts in everyday real-life situations. Occasionally, historical perspective has
been included to share the excitement of sequential development of the subject of
physics. Some Boxed items are introduced in many chapters either for this purpose
or to highlight some special features of the contents requiring additional attention
of the learners. Finally, a Subject Index has been added at the end of the book for
ease in locating keywords in the book.
The special nature of physics demands, apart from conceptual understanding,
the knowledge of certain conventions, basic mathematical tools, numerical values
of important physical constants, and systems of measurement units covering a
vast range from microscopic to galactic levels. In order to equip the students, we
have included the necessary tools and database in the form of Appendices A-1 to
A-9 at the end of the book. There are also some other appendices at the end of
some chapters giving additional information or applications of matter discussed in
that chapter.
Special attention has been paid for providing illustrative figures. To increase
the clarity, the figures are drawn in two colours. A large number of Exercises are
given at the end of each chapter. Some of these are from real-life situations. Students
are urged to solve these and in doing so, they may find them very educative. Moreover,
some Additional Exercises are given which are more challenging. Answers and
hints to solve some of these are also included. In the entire book, SI units have been
used. A comprehensive account of ‘units and measurement’ is given in Chapter 2 as a
part of prescribed syllabus/curriculum as well as a help in their pursuit of physics.
A box-item in this chapter brings out the difficulty in measuring as simple a thing as
the length of a long curved line. Tables of SI base units and other related units are
given here merely to indicate the presently accepted definitions and to indicate the
high degree of accuracy with which measurements are possible today. The numbers
given here are not to be memorised or asked in examinations.
There is a perception among students, teachers, as well as the general public
that there is a steep gradient between secondary and higher secondary stages.
But a little thought shows that it is bound to be there in the present scenario of
education. Education up to secondary stage is general education where a student
has to learn several subjects – sciences, social sciences, mathematics, languages,
at an elementary level. Education at the higher secondary stage and beyond, borders
on acquiring professional competence, in some chosen fields of endeavour. You
may like to compare this with the following situation. Children play cricket or
badminton in lanes and small spaces outside (or inside) their homes. But then

some of them want to make it to the school team, then district team, then State
team and then the National team. At every stage, there is bound to be a steep
gradient. Hard work would have to be put in whether students want to pursue
their education in the area of sciences, humanities, languages, music, fine arts,
commerce, finance, architecture, or if they want to become sportspersons or fashion
designers.
Completing this book has only been possible because of the spontaneous
and continuous support of many people. The Textbook Development Team is
thankful to Dr. V. H. Raybagkar for allowing us to use his box item in Chapter
4 and to Dr. F. I. Surve for allowing us to use two of his box items in Chapter 15.
We express also our gratitude to the Director, NCERT, for entrusting us with
the task of preparing this textbook as a part of national effort for improving
science education. The Head, Department of Education in Science and
Mathematics, NCERT, was always willing to help us in our endeavour in every
possible way.
The previous text got excellent academic inputs from teachers, students and
experts who sincerely suggested improvement during the past few years. We are
thankful to all those who conveyed these inputs to NCERT. We are also thankful to
the members of the Review Workshop and Editing Workshop organised to discuss
and refine the first draft. We thank the Chairmen and their teams of authors for
the text written by them in 1988, which provided the base and reference for
developing the 2002 version as well as the present version of the textbook.
Occasionally, substantial portions from the earlier versions, particularly those
appreciated by students/teachers, have been adopted/adapted and retained in
the present book for the benefit of coming generation of learners.
We welcome suggestions and comments from our valued users, especially
students and teachers. We wish our young readers a happy journey to the exciting
realm of physics.

OTE FOR THE EACHERS
To make the curriculum learner-centred, students should be made to participate and interact
in the learning process directly. Once a week or one out of every six classes would be a good
periodicity for such seminars and mutual interaction. Some suggestions for making the discussion
participatory are given below, with reference to some specific topics in this book.
Students may be divided into groups of five to six. The membership of these groups may be
rotated during the year, if felt necessary.
The topic for discussion can be presented on the board or on slips of paper. Students should
be asked to write their reactions or answers to questions, whichever is asked, on the given
sheets. They should then discuss in their groups and add modifications or comments in those
sheets. These should be discussed either in the same or in a different class. The sheets may also
be evaluated.
We suggest here three possible topics from the book. The first two topics suggested are, in
fact, very general and refer to the development of science over the past four centuries or more.
Students and teachers may think of more such topics for each seminar.
1. Ideas that changed civilisation
Suppose human beings are becoming extinct. A message has to be left for future generations or
alien visitors. Eminent physicist R P Feynmann wanted the following message left for future
beings, if any.
“Matter is made up of atoms”
A lady student and teacher of literature, wanted the following message left:
“Water existed, so human beings could happen”.
Another person thought it should be: “Idea of wheel for motion”
Write down what message each one of you would like to leave for future generations. Then
discuss it in your group and add or modify, if you want to change your mind. Give it to your
teacher and join in any discussion that follows.
2. Reductionism
Kinetic Theory of Gases relates the Big to the Small, the Macro to the Micro. A gas as a system
is related to its components, the molecules. This way of describing a system as a result of the
properties of its components is usually called Reductionism. It explains the behaviour of the
group by the simpler and predictable behaviour of individuals. Macroscopic observations and
microscopic properties have a mutual interdependence in this approach. Is this method useful?
This way of understanding has its limitations outside physics and chemistry, may be even
in these subjects. A painting cannot be discussed as a collection of the properties of chemicals
used in making the canvas and the painting. What emerges is more than the sum of its
components.
Question: Can you think of other areas where such an approach is used?
Describe briefly a system which is fully describable in terms of its components. Describe
one which is not. Discuss with other members of the group and write your views. Give it to your
teacher and join in any discussion that may follow.
3. Molecular approach to heat
Describe what you think will happen in the following case. An enclosure is separated by a
porous wall into two parts. One is filled with nitrogen gas (N ) and the other with CO . Gases
2 2
will diffuse from one side to the other.
Question 1: Will both gases diffuse to the same extent? If not, which will diffuse more. Give
reasons.
Question 2: Will the pressure and temperature be unchanged? If not, what will be the changes
in both. Give reasons.
Write down your answers. Discuss with the group and modify them or add comments.
Give to the teacher and join in the discussion.
Students and teachers will find that such seminars and discussions lead to tremendous
understanding, not only of physics, but also of science and social sciences. They also bring in
some maturity among students.

OVER DESIGN
(Adapted from the website of the Nobel Foundation
http://www.nobelprize.org)
The strong nuclear force binds protons and
neutrons in a nucleus and is the strongest of
nature’s four fundamental forces. A mystery
surrounding the strong nuclear force has been
solved. The three quarks within the proton can
sometimes appear to be free, although no free
quarks have ever been observed. The quarks
have a quantum mechanical property called
‘colour’ and interact with each other through
the exchange of particles called ‘gluons’
— nature glue.
