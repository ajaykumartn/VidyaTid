OREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on
the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They
also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures
will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system
of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own
learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must
recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new
knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.
Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one
of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat
children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of
knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode
of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as
rigour in implementing the annual calender so that the required number
of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for
teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook
proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather
than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to
address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and
reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for
child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space
to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee

responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the
advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and
the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor B. L. Khandelwal for guiding
the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the
development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for
making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and
organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their
resources, material and personnel. As an organisation committed to systemic
reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT
welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further
revision and refinement.

ATIONALISATION OF ONTENT IN HE EXTBOOKS
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content
load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises
reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential
learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has
undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes.
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes
have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:
• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in
the same class
• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same
subject
• Difficulty level
• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through
self-learning or peer-learning
• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the
changes given above.

REFACE
Chemistry has made a profound impact on the society. It is intimately linked
to the well-being of human kind. The rate of advancements in chemistry is so
high that curriculum developers continuously look for strategies to cope with
these advancements. Also, the students have to be inspired to be the future
leaders who would make fundamental contributions. The present textbook is
a sincere effort in this direction.
The structure of the textbook, presented in two parts, comprises of sixteen
Units. Although the titles of various Units indicate a sort of
compartmentalisation into physical, inorganic and organic chemistry, readers
will find that these sub-disciplines have been intermingled, at least to a certain
extent, to have a unified approach to the subject. The approach of presentation
of the subject matter discourages students from rote memorisation. The subject
has in fact, been organised around the laws and principles of chemistry. As
students master these laws and principles, they will soon get to the point
where they can predict much of what will come.
Efforts have been directed towards making the subject stimulating and
exciting by references to the historical developments and its usefulness to our
lives, wherever appropriate. The text is well illustrated with examples from
surrounding environment to facilitate grasping of the qualitative and
quantitative aspects of the concept easily. Physical data are given in SI units
throughout the book to make comparison of various properties easier. IUPAC
system of nomenclature has been followed along with the common system.
Structural formulae of chemical compounds showing functional/coordinating
groups in different colours are drawn using electronic system. Each Unit has
a good number of examples, as illustrations, with their solutions and some
intext questions, the answers of some of which are given at the end of the Unit.
The end of Unit exercises are designed to apply important principles and
provoke thinking process to solve them. Answers of some of these exercises
are given at the end of the book.
A variety of materials, e.g., biographical sketches of some scientists,
additional information related to a particular topic, etc., is given in boxes with
a deep yellow coloured bar. This boxed material with a 'deep yellow bar' is to
bring additional life to the topic. However, it is non-evaluative. The structures
of some of the more complex compounds incorporated in the book are for
understanding their chemistry. As their reproduction would lead to
memorisation, it is also a non-evaluative portion of the text.
The information part has been significantly reduced and, wherever possible,
it has been substantiated with facts. However, it is necessary for students to

be aware of commercially important chemicals, their process of manufacture
and sources of raw materials. This leads to descriptive material in the book.
Attempts have been made to make descriptions of such compounds interesting
by considering their structures and reactivity. Thermodynamics, kinetics and
electrochemical aspects have been applied to chemical reactions which should
be beneficial to students for understanding why a particular reaction happened
and why a particular property is exhibited by the product. There is currently
great awareness of environmental and energy issues which are directly related
to chemistry. Such issues have been highlighted and dealt with at appropriate
places in the book.
A team of experts constituted by the NCERT has developed the manuscript
of the book. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the valuable contribution
of all the members of this team. I also acknowledge the valuable and relentless
contribution of the editors in bringing the book to the present shape. I also
acknowledge with thanks the dedicated efforts and valuable contribution of
Professor Brahm Parkash, who not only coordinated the entire programme
but also actively involved in writing and editing of this book. Thanks are also
due to the participating teachers and subject experts of the review workshop
for their contribution, which has helped us to make the book learner friendly.
Also, I thank the technical and administrative staff of the NCERT for their
support in the entire process.
The team of this textbook development programme hopes that the book
stimulates its readers and makes them feel the excitement and fascination for
this subject. Efforts have been made to bring out this book error-free.
Nevertheless, it is recognised that in such a book of complexity, there could
inevitably be occasional errors. It will always be a pleasure to hear about
them from readers to take necessary steps to rectify them.
