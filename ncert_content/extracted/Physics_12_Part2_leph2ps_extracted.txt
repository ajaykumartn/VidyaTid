OREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends that children’s life at school must
be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish
learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and
community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement
this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly
further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on
Education (NPE), 1986.
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to
encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.
We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging
with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis
of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in
learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in
the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the
required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching
and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at
school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried
to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different
stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for
contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on
experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard
work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the
Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the
Chief Advisor for this book, Professor A.W. Joshi for guiding the work of this committee. Several
teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for
making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously
permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to
the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary
and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of
Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As
an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its
products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further
revision and refinement.

ATIONALISATION OF ONTENT IN THE EXTBOOKS
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on
students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the
content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative
mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise
the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT
across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:
• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same
class
• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject
• Difficulty level
• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions
from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-
learning
• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes
given above.

REFACE
It gives me pleasure to place this book in the hands of the students, teachers and the
public at large (whose role cannot be overlooked). It is a natural sequel to the Class XI
textbook which was brought out in 2006. This book is also a trimmed version of the
textbooks which existed so far. The chapter on thermal and chemical effects of current
has been cut out. This topic has also been dropped from the CBSE syllabus. Similarly,
the chapter on communications has been substantially curtailed. It has been rewritten
in an easily comprehensible form.
Although most other chapters have been based on the earlier versions, several parts
and sections in them have been rewritten. The Development Team has been guided by
the feedback received from innumerable teachers across the country.
In producing these books, Class XI as well as Class XII, there has been a basic
change of emphasis. Both the books present physics to students without assuming
that they would pursue this subject beyond the higher secondary level. This new view
has been prompted by the various observations and suggestions made in the National
Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005. Similarly, in today’s educational scenario where
students can opt for various combinations of subjects, we cannot assume that a physics
student is also studying mathematics. Therefore, physics has to be presented, so to
say, in a stand-alone form.
As in Class XI textbook, some interesting box items have been inserted in many
chapters. They are not meant for teaching or examinations. Their purpose is to catch
the attention of the reader, to show some applications in daily life or in other areas of
science and technology, to suggest a simple experiment, to show connection of concepts
in different areas of physics, and in general, to break the monotony and enliven the
book.
Features like Summary, Points to Ponder, Exercises and Additional Exercises at
the end of each chapter, and Examples have been retained. Several concept-based
Exercises have been transferred from end-of-chapter Exercises to Examples with
Solutions in the text. It is hoped that this will make the concepts discussed in the
chapter more comprehensible. Several new examples and exercises have been added.
Students wishing to pursue physics further would find Points to Ponder and Additional
Exercises very useful and thoughtful. To provide resources beyond the textbook and
to encourage eLearning, each chapter has been provided with some relevant website
addresses under the title ePhysics. These sites provide additional materials on specific
topics and also provide learners the opportunites for interactive demonstrations/
experiments.
The intricate concepts of physics must be understood, comprehended and
appreciated. Students must learn to ask questions like ‘why’, ‘how’, ‘how do we know
it’. They will find almost always that the question ‘why’ has no answer within the domain
of physics and science in general. But that itself is a learning experience, is it not? On
the other hand, the question ‘how’ has been reasonably well answered by physicists in
the case of most natural phenomena. In fact, with the understanding of how things
happen, it has been possible to make use of many phenomena to create technological
applications for the use of humans.

For example, consider statements in a book, like ‘A negatively charged electron is
attracted by the positively charged plate’, or ‘In this experiment, light (or electron)
behaves like a wave’. You will realise that it is not possible to answer ‘why’. This question
belongs to the domain of philosophy or metaphysics. But we can answer ‘how’, we can
find the force acting, we can find the wavelength of the photon (or electron), we can
determine how things behave under different conditions, and we can develop instruments
which will use these phenomena to our advantage.
It has been a pleasure to work for these books at the higher secondary level, along
with a team of members. The Textbook Development Team, the Review Team and Editing
Teams involved college and university teachers, teachers from Indian Institutes of
Technology, scientists from national institutes and laboratories, as well as higher
secondary teachers. The feedback and critical look provided by higher secondary
teachers in the various teams are highly laudable. Most box items were generated by
members of one or the other team, but three of them were generated by friends and
well-wishers not part of any team. We are thankful to Dr P.N. Sen of Pune, Professor
Roopmanjari Ghosh of Delhi and Dr Rajesh B Khaparde of Mumbai for allowing us to
use their box items, respectively in Chapters 3, 4 (Part I) and 9 (Part II). We are very
thankful to the members of the Review and Editing Workshops to discuss and refine
the first draft of the textbook. We also express our gratitude to Prof. Krishna Kumar,
Director, NCERT, for entrusting us with the task of presenting this textbook as a part of
the national effort for improving science education. I also thank Prof. G. Ravindra, Joint
Director, NCERT, for his help from time-to-time. Prof. Hukum Singh, Head, Department
of Education in Science and Mathematics, NCERT, was always willing to help us in our
endeavour in every possible way.
We welcome suggestions and comments from our valued users, especially students
and teachers. We wish our young readers a happy journey into the exciting realm of
physics.

Cut away view of International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)
device. The man in the bottom shows the scale.
ITER is a joint international research and development project that
aims to demonstrate the scientific and technical feasibility of fusion power.
India is one of the seven full partners in the project, the others being
the European Union (represented by EURATOM), Japan, the People’s
Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the
USA. ITER will be constructed in Europe, at Cadarache in the South of
France and will provide 500 MW of fusion power.
Fusion is the energy source of the sun and the stars. On earth, fusion
research is aimed at demonstrating that this energy source can be used to
produce electricity in a safe and environmentally benign way, with
abundant fuel resources, to meet the needs of a growing world population.
