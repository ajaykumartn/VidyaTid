MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
A.2.1 Introduction
In class XI, we have learnt about mathematical modelling as an attempt to study some
part (or form) of some real-life problems in mathematical terms, i.e., the conversion of
a physical situation into mathematics using some suitable conditions. Roughly speaking
mathematical modelling is an activity in which we make models to describe the behaviour
of various phenomenal activities of our interest in many ways using words, drawings or
sketches, computer programs, mathematical formulae etc.
In earlier classes, we have observed that solutions to many problems, involving
applications of various mathematical concepts, involve mathematical modelling in one
way or the other. Therefore, it is important to study mathematical modelling as a separate
topic.
In this chapter, we shall further study mathematical modelling of some real-life
problems using techniques/results from matrix, calculus and linear programming.
A.2.2 Why Mathematical Modelling?
Students are aware of the solution of word problems in arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry
and linear programming etc. Sometimes we solve the problems without going into the
physical insight of the situational problems. Situational problems need physical insight
that is introduction of physical laws and some symbols to compare the mathematical
results obtained with practical values. To solve many problems faced by us, we need a
technique and this is what is known as mathematical modelling. Let us consider the
following problems:
(i) To find the width of a river (particularly, when it is difficult to cross the river).
(ii) To find the optimal angle in case of shot-put (by considering the variables
such as : the height of the thrower, resistance of the media, acceleration due to
gravity etc.).
(iii) To find the height of a tower (particularly, when it is not possible to reach the top
of the tower).
(iv) To find the temperature at the surface of the Sun.

(v) Why heart patients are not allowed to use lift? (without knowing the physiology
of a human being).
(vi) To find the mass of the Earth.
(vii) Estimate the yield of pulses in India from the standing crops (a person is not
allowed to cut all of it).
(viii) Find the volume of blood inside the body of a person (a person is not allowed to
bleed completely).
(ix) Estimate the population of India in the year 2020 (a person is not allowed to wait
till then).
All of these problems can be solved and infact have been solved with the help of
Mathematics using mathematical modelling. In fact, you might have studied the methods
for solving some of them in the present textbook itself. However, it will be instructive if
you first try to solve them yourself and that too without the help of Mathematics, if
possible, you will then appreciate the power of Mathematics and the need for
mathematical modelling.
A.2.3 Principles of Mathematical Modelling
Mathematical modelling is a principled activity and so it has some principles behind it.
These principles are almost philosophical in nature. Some of the basic principles of
mathematical modelling are listed below in terms of instructions:
(i) Identify the need for the model. (for what we are looking for)
(ii) List the parameters/variables which are required for the model.
(iii) Identify the available relevent data. (what is given?)
(iv) Identify the circumstances that can be applied (assumptions)
(v) Identify the governing physical principles.
(vi) Identify
(a) the equations that will be used.
(b) the calculations that will be made.
(c) the solution which will follow.
(vii) Identify tests that can check the
(a) consistency of the model.
(b) utility of the model.
(viii) Identify the parameter values that can improve the model.

The above principles of mathematical modelling lead to the following: steps for
mathematical modelling.
Step 1: Identify the physical situation.
Step 2: Convert the physical situation into a mathematical model by introducing
parameters / variables and using various known physical laws and symbols.
Step 3: Find the solution of the mathematical problem.
Step 4: Interpret the result in terms of the original problem and compare the result
with observations or experiments.
Step 5: If the result is in good agreement, then accept the model. Otherwise modify
the hypotheses / assumptions according to the physical situation and go to
Step 2.
The above steps can also be viewed through the following diagram:
Fig A.2.1
Example 1 Find the height of a given tower using mathematical modelling.
Solution Step 1 Given physical situation is “to find the height of a given tower”.
Step 2 Let AB be the given tower (Fig A.2.2). Let PQ be an observer measuring the
height of the tower with his eye at P. Let PQ = h and let height of tower be H. Let α
be the angle of elevation from the eye of the observer to the top of the tower.

Let l =PC = QB
AC H−h
Now tanα = =
PC l
or H = h + l tan α ... (1)
Step 3 Note that the values of the parameters h, l and α (using sextant) are known to
the observer and so (1) gives the solution of the problem.
Step 4 In case, if the foot of the tower is not accessible, i.e., when l is not known to the
observer, let β be the angle of depression from P to the foot B of the tower. So from
∆PQB, we have
PQ h
tanβ= = or l = h cot β
QB l
Step 5 is not required in this situation as exact values of the parameters h, l, α and β
are known.
Example 2 Let a business firm produces three types of products P , P and P that
1 2 3
uses three types of raw materials R , R and R . Let the firm has purchase orders from
1 2 3
two clients F and F . Considering the situation that the firm has a limited quantity of
1 2
R , R and R , respectively, prepare a model to determine the quantities of the raw
1 2 3
material R , R and R required to meet the purchase orders.
1 2 3
Solution Step 1 The physical situation is well identified in the problem.
Step 2 Let A be a matrix that represents purchase orders from the two clients F and

F . Then, A is of the form

This clearly shows that to meet the purchase order of F and F , the raw material
1 2
required is 335 units of R , 467 units of R and 147 units of R which is much more than
1 2 3
the available raw material. Since the amount of raw material required to manufacture
each unit of the three products is fixed, we can either ask for an increase in the
available raw material or we may ask the clients to reduce their orders.

This requires 311 units of R , 436 units of R and 138 units of R which are well
1 2 3
below the available raw materials, i.e., 330 units of R , 455 units of R and 140 units of

R . Thus, if the revised purchase orders of the clients are given by A , then the firm

can easily supply the purchase orders of the two clients.

Query Can we make a mathematical model with a given B and with fixed quantities of

The answer to this query is given in the following example:
Example 4 Suppose P , P , P and R , R , R are as in Example 2. Let the firm has

330 units of R , 455 units of R and 140 units of R available with it and let the amount

How many units of each product is to be made so as to utilise the full available raw
material?
Solution Step 1 The situation is easily identifiable.
Step 2 Suppose the firm produces x units of P , y units of P and z units of P . Since
1 2 3
product P requires 3 units of R , P requires 7 units of R and P requires 5 units of R
1 1 2 1 3 1
(observe matrix B) and the total number of units, of R , available is 330, we have

3x + 7y + 5z =330 (for raw material R )

Similarly, we have
4x + 9y + 12z =455 (for raw material R )
2
and 3y + 7z =140 (for raw material R )

This gives x = 20, y = 35 and z = 5. Thus, the firm can produce 20 units of P , 35

units of P and 5 units of P to make full use of its available raw material.
2 3
Remark One may observe that if the manufacturer decides to manufacture according
to the available raw material and not according to the purchase orders of the two
clients F and F (as in Example 3), he/she is unable to meet these purchase orders as
1 2
F demanded 6 units of P where as the manufacturer can make only 5 units of P .

Example 5 A manufacturer of medicines is preparing a production plan of medicines
M and M . There are sufficient raw materials available to make 20000 bottles of M
1 2 1
and 40000 bottles of M , but there are only 45000 bottles into which either of the
2
medicines can be put. Further, it takes 3 hours to prepare enough material to fill 1000
bottles of M , it takes 1 hour to prepare enough material to fill 1000 bottles of M and
1 2
there are 66 hours available for this operation. The profit is Rs 8 per bottle for M and
1
Rs 7 per bottle for M . How should the manufacturer schedule his/her production in
2
order to maximise profit?
Solution Step 1 To find the number of bottles of M and M in order to maximise the
1 2
profit under the given hypotheses.
Step 2 Let x be the number of bottles of type M medicine and y be the number of
1
bottles of type M medicine. Since profit is Rs 8 per bottle for M and Rs 7 per bottle
2 1
for M , therefore the objective function (which is to be maximised) is given by
2
Z ≡ Z (x, y) = 8x + 7y
The objective function is to be maximised subject to the constraints (Refer Chapter

Note that
Z at P (0, 0) = 0
Z at P (20000, 0) = 8 × 20000 = 160000
Z at Q (20000, 6000) = 8 × 20000 + 7 × 6000 = 202000
Z at R (10500, 34500) = 8 × 10500 + 7 × 34500 = 325500
Z at S = (5000, 40000) = 8 × 5000 + 7 × 40000 = 320000
Z at T = (0, 40000) = 7 × 40000 = 280000
Now observe that the profit is maximum at x = 10500 and y = 34500 and the
maximum profit is `325500. Hence, the manufacturer should produce 10500 bottles of
M medicine and 34500 bottles of M medicine in order to get maximum profit of
1 2
`325500.
Example 6 Suppose a company plans to produce a new product that incur some costs
(fixed and variable) and let the company plans to sell the product at a fixed price.
Prepare a mathematical model to examine the profitability.
Solution Step 1 Situation is clearly identifiable.

Step 2 Formulation: We are given that the costs are of two types: fixed and variable.
The fixed costs are independent of the number of units produced (e.g., rent and rates),
while the variable costs increase with the number of units produced (e.g., material).
Initially, we assume that the variable costs are directly proportional to the number of
units produced — this should simplify our model. The company earn a certain amount
of money by selling its products and wants to ensure that it is maximum. For convenience,
we assume that all units produced are sold immediately.
The mathematical model
Let x =number of units produced and sold
C =total cost of production (in rupees)
I =income from sales (in rupees)
P = profit (in rupees)
Our assumptions above state that C consists of two parts:
(i) fixed cost = a (in rupees),
(ii) variable cost = b (rupees/unit produced).
Then C =a + bx ... (1)
Also, income I depends on selling price s (rupees/unit)
Thus I =sx ... (2)
The profit P is then the difference between income and costs. So
P = I – C
=sx – (a + bx)
=(s – b) x – a ... (3)
We now have a mathematical model of the relationships (1) to (3) between
the variables x, C, I, P, a, b, s. These variables may be classified as:
independent x
dependent C, I, P
parameters a, b, s
The manufacturer, knowing x, a, b, s can determine P.
Step 3 From (3), we can observe that for the break even point (i.e., make neither profit
a
nor loss), he must have P = 0, i.e., x= units.
s−b
Steps 4 and 5 In view of the break even point, one may conclude that if the company
a
produces few units, i.e., less than x= units, then the company will suffer loss

a
and if it produces large number of units, i.e., much more than units, then it can
s−b
make huge profit. Further, if the break even point proves to be unrealistic, then another
model could be tried or the assumptions regarding cash flow may be modified.
Remark From (3), we also have
dP
=s−b
dx
This means that rate of change of P with respect to x depends on the quantity
s – b, which is the difference of selling price and the variable cost of each product.
Thus, in order to gain profit, this should be positive and to get large gains, we need to
produce large quantity of the product and at the same time try to reduce the variable
cost.
Example 7 Let a tank contains 1000 litres of brine which contains 250 g of salt per
litre. Brine containing 200 g of salt per litre flows into the tank at the rate of 25 litres per
minute and the mixture flows out at the same rate. Assume that the mixture is kept
uniform all the time by stirring. What would be the amount of salt in the tank at
any time t?
Solution Step 1 The situation is easily identifiable.
Step 2 Let y = y (t) denote the amount of salt (in kg) in the tank at time t (in minutes)
after the inflow, outflow starts. Further assume that y is a differentiable function.
When t = 0, i.e., before the inflow–outflow of the brine starts,
y = 250 g × 1000 = 250 kg
Note that the change in y occurs due to the inflow, outflow of the mixture.
Now the inflow of brine brings salt into the tank at the rate of 5 kg per minute
(as 25 × 200 g = 5 kg) and the outflow of brine takes salt out of the tank at the rate of
 y  y y
25    = kg per minute (as at time t, the salt in the tank is kg).
1000 40 1000

given by

ye40 =200e40 +C or y (t) = 200 + C e 40 ... (2)
where, c is the constant of integration.
Note that when t = 0, y = 250. Therefore, 250 = 200 + C

Here, the equation (4) gives the time t at which the salt in tank is y kg.
− t
Step 4 Since e 40 is always positive, from (3), we conclude that y > 200 at all times
Thus, the minimum amount of salt content in the tank is 200 kg.
Also, from (4), we conclude that t > 0 if and only if 0 < y – 200 < 50 i.e., if and only
if 200 < y < 250 i.e., the amount of salt content in the tank after the start of inflow and
outflow of the brine is between 200 kg and 250 kg.
Limitations of Mathematical Modelling
Till today many mathematical models have been developed and applied successfully
to understand and get an insight into thousands of situations. Some of the subjects like
mathematical physics, mathematical economics, operations research, bio-mathematics
etc. are almost synonymous with mathematical modelling.
But there are still a large number of situations which are yet to be modelled. The
reason behind this is that either the situation are found to be very complex or the
mathematical models formed are mathematically intractable.

MATHEMATICAL MODELLING 207
The development of the powerful computers and super computers has enabled us
to mathematically model a large number of situations (even complex situations). Due
to these fast and advanced computers, it has been possible to prepare more realistic
models which can obtain better agreements with observations.
However, we do not have good guidelines for choosing various parameters / variables
and also for estimating the values of these parameters / variables used in a mathematical
model. Infact, we can prepare reasonably accurate models to fit any data by choosing
five or six parameters / variables. We require a minimal number of parameters / variables
to be able to estimate them accurately.
Mathematical modelling of large or complex situations has its own special problems.
These type of situations usually occur in the study of world models of environment,
oceanography, pollution control etc. Mathematical modellers from all disciplines —
mathematics, computer science, physics, engineering, social sciences, etc., are involved
in meeting these challenges with courage.
