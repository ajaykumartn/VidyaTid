OREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends that children’s
life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks
a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our
system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi
and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement
this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance
of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures
will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of
education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and
teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to
pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space,
time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the
information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as
the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and
sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we
perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed
body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of
functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in
implementing the annual calender so that the required number of teaching days
are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation
will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at
school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus
designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring
and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child
psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance
this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for
contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring
hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group
in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for
this book, Professor B. L. Khandelwal for guiding the work of this committee.

Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful
to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions
and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their
resources, material and personnel. As an organisation committed to systemic
reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT
welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further
revision and refinement.

ATIONALISATION OF ONTENT IN THE EXTBOOK
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on
students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the
content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative
mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to
rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed
by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:
• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same
class
• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject
• Difficulty level
• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions
from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-
learning
• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the
changes given above.

REFACE
Chemistry has made a profound impact on the society. It is intimately linked
to the well-being of human kind. The rate of advancements in chemistry is so
high that curriculum developers continuously look for strategies to cope with
these advancements. Also, the students have to be inspired to be the future
leaders who would make fundamental contributions. The present textbook is
a sincere effort in this direction.
The textbook, presented in two parts, comprises of sixteen Units. Although
the titles of various Units indicate a sort of compartmentalisation into physical,
inorganic and organic chemistry, readers will find that these sub-disciplines
have been intermingled, at least to a certain extent, to have a unified approach
to the subject. First nine Units covering physical and inorganic chemistry
portions are included in Part I while organic chemistry portion comprising of
seven Units is included in Part II of the book. The approach of presentation
of the subject matter discourages students from rote memorisation. The subject
has in fact, been organised around the laws and principles of chemistry. As
students master these laws and principles, they will soon get to the point
where they can predict much of what will come.
Efforts have been directed towards making the subject stimulating and exciting
by references to the historical developments and its usefulness to our lives,
wherever appropriate. The text is well illustrated with examples from
surrounding environment to facilitate grasping of the qualitative and
quantitative aspects of the concept easily. Physical data are given in SI units
throughout the book to make comparison of various properties easier. IUPAC
system of nomenclature has been followed along with the common names.
Structural formulae of chemical compounds showing functional/coordinating
groups in different colours are drawn using electronic system. Each Unit has
a good number of examples, as illustrations, with their solutions and some
intext questions, the answers of some of which are given at the end of the Unit.
The end of Unit exercises are designed to apply important principles and
provoke thinking process to solve them. Answers of some of these exercises
are given at the end of the book.
A variety of materials, e.g., biographical sketches of some scientists, additional
information related to a particular topic, etc., is given in boxes with a deep
yellow coloured bar. This boxed material with a 'deep yellow bar' is to bring
additional life to the topic. However, it is non-evaluative. The structures of
some of the more complex compounds incorporated in the book are for
understanding their chemistry. As their reproduction would lead to
memorisation, it is also a non-evaluative portion of the text.

The information part has been significantly reduced and, wherever possible,
it has been substantiated with facts. However, it is necessary for students to
be aware of commercially important chemicals, their processes of manufacture
and sources of raw materials. This leads to descriptive material in the book.
Attempts have been made to make descriptions of such compounds interesting
by considering their structures and reactivity. Thermodynamics, kinetics and
electrochemical aspects have been applied to a few chemical reactions which
should be beneficial to students for understanding why a particular reaction
happened and why a particular property is exhibited by the product. There
is currently great awareness of environmental and energy issues which are
directly related to chemistry. Such issues have been highlighted and dealt
with at appropriate places in the book.
A team of experts constituted by the NCERT has developed the manuscript of
the book. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the valuable contribution
of all the members of this team. I also acknowledge the valuable and relentless
contribution of the editors in bringing the book to the present shape. I also
acknowledge with thanks the dedicated efforts and valuable contribution of
Professor Brahm Parkash, who not only coordinated the entire programme
but also actively involved in writing and editing of this book. Thanks are also
due to the participating teachers and subject experts of the review workshop
for their contribution, which has helped us to make the book learner friendly.
Also, I thank the technical and administrative staff of the NCERT for their
support in the entire process.
The team of this textbook development programme hopes that the book
stimulates its readers and makes them feel the excitement and fascination for
this subject. Efforts have been made to bring out this book error-free.
Nevertheless, it is recognised that in a book of this complexity, there could
inevitably be occasional errors. It will always be a pleasure to hear about
them from readers to take necessary steps to rectify them.
