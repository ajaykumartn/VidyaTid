1.15 ≅ 104; intermolecular separation in a gas is much larger than the size of a molecule.
1.16 Near objects make greater angle than distant (far off) objects at the eye of the observer.
When you are moving, the angular change is less for distant objects than nearer objects.
So, these distant objects seem to move along with you, but the nearer objects in opposite
direction.
1.17 1.4 × 103 kg m-3; the mass density of the Sun is in the range of densities of liquids /
solids and not gases. This high density arises due to inward gravitational attraction
on outer layers due to inner layers of the Sun.

4.1 (a) to (d) No net force according to the First Law
(e) No force, since it is far away from all material agencies producing electromagnetic
and gravitational forces.
4.2 The only force in each case is the force of gravity, (neglecting effects of air) equal to
0.5 N vertically downward. The answers do not change, even if the motion of the pebble
is not along the vertical. The pebble is not at rest at the highest point. It has a constant
horizontal component of velocity throughout its motion.
4.3 (a) 1 N vertically downwards (b) same as in (a)

on history.

4.11 (a) Velocity of car ( at t = 10 s ) = 0 + 2 × 10 = 20 m s–1
By the First Law, the horizontal component of velocity is 20 m s–1 throughout.
Vertical component of velocity (at t = 11s) = 0 + 10 × 1 = 10 m s–1
Velocity of stone (at t = 11s) = 20 2 +10 2 = 500 =22.4 m s –1 at an angle of tan–1 ( ½) with
the horizontal.

4.12 (a) At the extreme position, the speed of the bob is zero. If the string is cut, it will fall
vertically downwards.
(b) At the mean position, the bob has a horizontal velocity. If the string is cut, it will fall
along a parabolic path.
4.13 The reading on the scale is a measure of the force on the floor by the man. By the Third
Law, this is equal and opposite to the normal force N on the man by the floor.
(a) N = 70 × 10 = 700 N ; Reading is 70 kg
(b) 70 × 10 – N = 70 × 5 ; Reading is 35 kg
(c) N – 70 × 10 = 70 × 5 ; Reading is 105 kg
(d) 70 × 10 – N = 70 × 10; Reading would be zero; the scale would read zero.
4.14 (a) In all the three intervals, acceleration and, therefore, force are zero.
(b) 3 kg m s–1 at t = 0 ; (c) –3 kg m s–1 at t = 4 s.
4.15 If the 20 kg mass is pulled,
600 – T = 20 a, T = 10 a
a = 20 m s–2, T = 200 N
If the 10 kg mass is pulled, a = 20 m s–2, T = 400 N
4.16 T – 8 × 10 = 8 a, 12 × 10 – T = 12a
i.e. a = 2 m s–2, T = 96 N
4.17 By momentum conservation principle, total final momentum is zero. Two momentum
vectors cannot sum to a null momentum unless they are equal and opposite.
4.18 Impulse on each ball = 0.05 ×12 = 0.6 kg m s-1 in magnitude. The two impulses are
opposite in direction.
4.19 Use momentum conservation : 100 v = 0.02 × 80

4.22 Alternative (b) is correct, according to the First Law
4.23 (a) The horse-cart system has no external force in empty space. The mutual forces
between the horse and the cart cancel (Third Law). On the ground, the contact force
between the system and the ground (friction) causes their motion from rest.
(b) Due to inertia of the body not directly in contact with the seat.
(c) A lawn mower is pulled or pushed by applying force at an angle. When you push, the
normal force (N) must be more than its weight, for equilibrium in the vertical direction.
This results in greater friction f ( f ∝ N) and, therefore, a greater applied force to move.
Just the opposite happens while pulling.
(d) To reduce the rate of change of momentum and hence to reduce the force necessary
to stop the ball.

5.14 Yes, momentum of the molecule + wall system is conserved. The wall has a recoil
momentum such that the momentum of the wall + momentum of the outgoing molecule
equals momentum of the incoming molecule, assuming the wall to be stationary initially.
However, the recoil momentum produces negligible velocity because of the large mass of
the wall. Since kinetic energy is also conserved, the collision is elastic.
