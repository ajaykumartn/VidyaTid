9.11 No, Bernoulli’s principle applies to streamline flow only.
9.12 No, unless the atmospheric pressures at the two points where Bernoulli’s equation is
applied are significantly different.
9.13 9.8 × 102 Pa (The Reynolds number is about 0.3 so the flow is laminar).
9.14 1.5 × 103 N
9.15 Fig (a) is incorrect [Reason: at a constriction (i.e. where the area of cross-section of the
tube is smaller), flow speed is larger due to mass conservation. Consequently pressure
there is smaller according to Bernoulli’s equation. We assume the fluid to be
incompressible].
9.16 0.64 m s–1
9.17 2.5 × 10–2 N m–1
9.18 4.5 × 10–2 N for (b) and (c), the same as in (a).
9.19 Excess pressure = 310 Pa, total pressure = 1.0131 × 105 Pa. However, since data are
correct to three significant figures, we should write total pressure inside the drop as
1.01 × 105 Pa.
9.20 Excess pressure inside the soap bubble = 20.0 Pa; excess pressure inside the air bubble
in soap solution = 10.0 Pa. Outside pressure for air bubble = 1.01 × 105 + 0.4 × 103 × 9.8
× 1.2 = 1.06 × 105 Pa. The excess pressure is so small that up to three significant
figures, total pressure inside the air bubble is 1.06 × 105 Pa.

of the gas at triple point should be extrapolated to obtain temperature in the limit
pressure tends to zero, when the gases approach ideal gas behaviour.
10.6 Actual length of the rod at 45.0 °C = (63.0 + 0.0136) cm = 63.0136 cm. (However, we
should say that change in length up to three significant figures is 0.0136 cm, but the
total length is 63.0 cm, up to three significant places. Length of the same rod at 27.0 °C

10.15 The gases are diatomic, and have other degrees of freedom (i.e. have other modes of
motion) possible besides the translational degrees of freedom. To raise the temperature
of the gas by a certain amount, heat is to be supplied to increase the average energy of
all the modes. Consequently, molar specific heat of diatomic gases is more than that of
monatomic gases. It can be shown that if only rotational modes of motion are considered,
the molar specific heat of diatomic gases is nearly (5/2) R which agrees with the
observations for all the gases listed in the table, except chlorine. The higher value of
molar specific heat of chlorine indicates that besides rotational modes, vibrational modes
are also present in chlorine at room temperature.

collisional frequency = rms = 5.1· 109s–1 . Time taken for the collision = d / v = 4 × 10–13 s.

Time taken between successive collisions = l / v = 2 × 10-10 s. Thus the time taken
rms
between successive collisions is 500 times the time taken for a collision. Thus a molecule
in a gas moves essentially free for most of the time.
